GLIST WRAPPERS
=======================================================================

This is for those who don't have a working suidperl.
Just do:

	make
	make install

and change the alias stuff to:

glist:		"|/opt/glist/bin/gdefer-wrapper"
glist-request: 	"|/opt/glist/bin/gcmd-wrapper"
list:		"|/opt/glist/bin/gfetch-wrapper list@list.org"
list-request:	"|/opt/glist/bin/gcmd-wrapper list@list.org"

that should be about it.

If you have mounted anything nosuid, you can
change the PREFIX in the Makefile to somewhere you can run suid.

If you have installed glist somewhere else than /opt/glist
you can change this in include/glist.h
