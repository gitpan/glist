Q: Do i have to restart glist when i change my configuration?
A: Yes. Configuration is only read once.
   You can send daemons the HUP signal to make them restart,
   this is what `glistctl restart` does.

Q: I keep getting the message:
	fatal: execvp /usr/glist/bin/gfetch: Permission denied
   or:
	(Command died with status 1: "/usr/glist/bin/gfetch")
   from my mailer-daemon when i send mail to a list.
A: Does the mailer-daemon have permissions to execute programs
   in PREFIX/opt, or PREFIX?
   Possible solution:
   chmod 711 PREFIX PREFIX/bin

Q: HELP! Suidperl is not working.
A: See div/wrapper-solution/README and configure with --with-wrappers

Q: I use the DB2 support and get the following error
   in my logfiles:
   "Total Environment allocation failure!  
   Did you set up your DB2 client environment?"
A: You must add the following to the glist users ~/.profile:

   . /opt/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile

   Where /opt/db2inst1 is the homedirectory of the db2 installation
   user.

   Then do a relogin and a `glistctl reload' for the sendd daemon to reload
   it's environment.
